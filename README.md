Overview:

This project analyzes global earthquake occurrences and their magnitudes from 1995 to 2023. Utilizing R-Studio for comprehensive data analysis, the project aims to uncover patterns and insights into seismic activities worldwide, helping to enhance awareness and preparedness.

Features:

Data Analysis: In-depth analysis of global earthquake data to track frequency and magnitude trends over time.

Visualization:  visualization techniques using ggplot2 and sf in R to map the distribution of earthquakes globally.

Spatial Analysis: Utilization of geospatial data and techniques to associate earthquake events with specific geographic locations.

Interactive Reporting: Detailed reporting and insights into earthquake patterns and potential hotspots.

Data Source

The earthquake data is sourced from the Kaggle Earthquake Dataset, specifically the Earthquake_1995-2023 dataset, which contains comprehensive records of global seismic activities.

Tools Used

R-Studio: For data analysis and visualization.

ggplot2: For creating static and dynamic visualizations.

sf: For handling spatial data and performing geospatial analysis.

dplyr: For data manipulation and transformation.
